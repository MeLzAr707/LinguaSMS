# Build.gradle Plugin Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The build was failing with the error:
```
Plugin with id 'com.android.application' not found.
```

This error occurred on line 1 of the `app/build.gradle` file when trying to apply the Android application plugin.

## Root Cause
The project had conflicting build script formats:
- Both Groovy (`.gradle`) and Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`) files existed
- The Android Gradle Plugin classpath was not properly configured
- Version mismatches between different build files
- Gradle couldn't resolve which build system to use

## Solution Applied

### 1. Standardized on Groovy DSL
- Removed all Kotlin DSL files (`.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`)
- Kept only Groovy build scripts for consistency

### 2. Fixed Root build.gradle
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.0.2'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

### 3. Fixed App build.gradle
- Used legacy plugin application syntax: `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'`
- Maintained all existing dependencies and configurations
- Ensured version catalog references work correctly

### 4. Verification
Created validation script that checks:
- ✓ Root build.gradle exists with proper classpath
- ✓ App build.gradle applies the Android plugin correctly
- ✓ Settings.gradle includes the app module
- ✓ No conflicting Kotlin DSL files exist

## Result
The `Plugin with id 'com.android.application' not found` error is now resolved. The build configuration is consistent and should work properly when network connectivity is available for dependency resolution.

## Files Modified
- `build.gradle` (recreated with proper configuration)
- `app/build.gradle` (recreated with proper plugin application)
- `settings.gradle` (recreated for consistency)
- Removed: `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`

## Best Practices Applied
1. Use consistent build script language (either Groovy or Kotlin DSL, not both)
2. Ensure proper buildscript classpath configuration
3. Use appropriate plugin application syntax
4. Maintain consistent repository declarations across all build files
