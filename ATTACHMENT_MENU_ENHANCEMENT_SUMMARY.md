# LinguaSMS Attachment Menu Enhancement Summary 

## 🎯 Issue Addressed
Fixed the attachment menu layout that was "scrunched up" and completed implementation of all menu features as requested in [Issue #590](https://github.com/MeLzAr707/LinguaSMS/issues/590).

## 🎨 Layout Improvements

### Before (Issues)
- Fixed width of 280dp causing cramped appearance
- Small 48dp icons difficult to tap
- Tight 12dp padding creating crowded layout
- Small 12sp text hard to read
- Basic elevation and styling

### After (Enhanced)
- **Responsive Width**: Changed to wrap_content with 300dp-380dp constraints
- **Larger Icons**: Increased from 48dp to 56dp for better touch targets
- **Better Spacing**: Enhanced padding from 12dp to 16dp
- **Improved Typography**: Text size increased from 12sp to 13sp
- **Modern Styling**: Enhanced corner radius (20dp) and elevation (12dp)
- **Better Margins**: Row spacing increased from 8dp to 16dp

## 🛠️ Functionality Enhancements

  - Actual photo/video capture
