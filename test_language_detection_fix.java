// Simple test to verify the language detection integration
// This file is created to manually verify the logic without needing full build environment

/*
 * Test Case: Verify that TranslationManager now uses LanguageDetectionService
 * instead of hard-coding "en" for source language detection.
 * 
 * Before fix:
 * - translateText() would hard-code finalSourceLanguage = "en" in two places
 * - translateSmsMessage() would hard-code detectedLanguage = "en" for offline mode
 * 
 * After fix:
 * - Both methods use languageDetectionService.detectLanguageSync(text)
 * - ML Kit is used for primary detection with Google Translate API fallback
 * - No more hard-coded English assumptions

    /* 
     * Key changes made in TranslationManager:
     * 
     * 1. Added LanguageDetectionService field and initialization
     * 2. Replaced line ~175: "finalSourceLanguage = "en";" 
     *    with: "finalSourceLanguage = languageDetectionService.detectLanguageSync(text);"
     * 3. Replaced line ~310: "detectedLanguage = "en";" 
     *    with: "detectedLanguage = languageDetectionService.detectLanguageSync(message.getOriginalText());"
     * 4. Added cleanup for languageDetectionService
     * 
     * This ensures Spanish text like "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" is properly detected as "es"
     * instead of being assumed as "en", allowing proper translation to occur.
