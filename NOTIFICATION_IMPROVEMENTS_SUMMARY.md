# Notification Improvements Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Notifications shown when conversation is already open
**Problem**: The app shows a notification when a new message is received, even if the user is already viewing the conversation thread the message belongs to.

**Solution**: Implemented conversation activity tracking to suppress notifications when the relevant conversation is currently being viewed.

### Issue 2: Notifications don't show full message content
**Problem**: Notifications truncate long messages, making it difficult to read the full content.

**Solution**: Enhanced SMS notifications to use `BigTextStyle` which allows full message content to be displayed when the notification is expanded.

## Files Modified

### 1. ConversationActivity.java
- **Added**: Static field `currentlyActiveThreadId` to track currently active conversation
- **Added**: `isThreadCurrentlyActive(String threadId)` method for checking if a thread is being viewed
- **Modified**: `onResume()` to set active thread ID when conversation becomes visible
- **Modified**: `onPause()` to clear active thread ID when conversation becomes invisible

### 2. MessageService.java
- **Modified**: SMS notification logic to check if conversation is active before showing notification
- **Added**: Thread activity check using `ConversationActivity.isThreadCurrentlyActive(threadId)`
- **Result**: Notifications are suppressed when user is viewing the relevant conversation

### 3. NotificationHelper.java
- **Enhanced**: `showSmsReceivedNotification()` to use `NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle`
- **Added**: `setBigContentTitle(sender)` for better presentation in expanded view
- **Result**: Full message content is visible when notification is expanded

### 4. NotificationTest.java
- **Added**: Tests for thread tracking functionality
- **Added**: Test for BigTextStyle notification creation
- **Enhanced**: Comprehensive test coverage for new features

### 5. DebugActivity.java + activity_debug.xml
- **Added**: Test notification button for manual testing
- **Added**: `testNotification()` method that sends test notifications with both short and long messages
- **Added**: Instructions for testing notification suppression feature

## How It Works

### Notification Suppression Logic
1. When a `ConversationActivity` becomes visible (`onResume`), it sets the static `currentlyActiveThreadId`
2. When the activity becomes invisible (`onPause`), it clears the static field
3. When `MessageService` receives an SMS, it checks if the thread is currently active
4. If active, the notification is suppressed with a log message
5. If not active, the notification is shown normally

### Full Message Display
1. SMS notifications now use `NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle` instead of basic text
2. When user expands the notification, the full message content is visible
3. The sender name remains visible in the expanded view via `setBigContentTitle`

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests verify the core logic works correctly in all scenarios
- Tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and null handling
- All tests pass successfully

### Manual Testing via DebugActivity
1. Open the app and navigate to Debug/Testing section
2. Tap "Test Notification" button
3. Two test notifications will appear (short and long message)
4. Verify that long message shows full content when expanded
5. Open a conversation for one of the test threads
6. Send another notification for that thread - it should be suppressed
7. Switch to a different conversation - notifications for other threads should still appear

### Real-world Testing
1. Set LinguaSMS as default SMS app
2. Send SMS to the device from another phone
3. Verify notification appears with full message content
4. Open the conversation for that sender
5. Send another SMS - notification should be suppressed
6. Close the conversation - subsequent SMS should show notifications again

## Benefits

1. **Reduced notification noise**: Users won't see redundant notifications for conversations they're actively viewing
2. **Better user experience**: Full message content is always accessible in notifications
3. **Minimal code changes**: Implementation is surgical and doesn't affect other functionality
4. **Robust handling**: Works correctly in all edge cases including conversation switching and app lifecycle events
