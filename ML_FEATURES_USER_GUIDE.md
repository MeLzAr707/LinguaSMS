## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Text is too short to summarize"
**Solution**: Add more content. Summaries work best with at least 100 characters.

### "No reply suggestions available"
**Possible causes:**
- Conversation history is too short
- Messages are not in English
- Topic might be sensitive or inappropriate
**Solution**: Try with a different conversation or add more message history.

### Features seem slow
**Normal behavior**: AI processing takes time. Features run in the background so you can continue using the app.

### Feature not appearing in menu
**Check**: Make sure you're in a conversation (not the main message list).
