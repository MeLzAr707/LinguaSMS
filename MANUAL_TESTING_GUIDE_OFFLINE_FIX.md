# Manual Testing Guide for Offline Translation Fixes
# This script demonstrates how to manually test the offline translation fixes

echo "=== Manual Testing Guide for Offline Translation Fixes ==="
echo

echo "The following fixes have been implemented to resolve offline translation errors:"
echo
echo "1. LANGUAGE CODE CONSISTENCY FIX"
echo "   Problem: OfflineModelManager used 'zh-CN' and 'zh-TW' but OfflineTranslationService expected 'zh'"
echo "   Solution: Unified Chinese language code to 'zh' in both services"
echo "   Test: Download Chinese model and verify translation works"
echo

echo "2. MISSING LANGUAGE MAPPING FIX"
echo "   Problem: Greek ('el') was available in OfflineModelManager but not mapped in OfflineTranslationService"
echo "   Solution: Added Greek language mapping to convertToMLKitLanguageCode method"
echo "   Test: Download Greek model and verify it's recognized for translation"
echo

echo "3. MLKIT TIMEOUT IMPROVEMENT"
echo "   Problem: 2-second timeout was too short, causing valid models to appear unavailable"
echo "   Solution: Increased timeout from 2 seconds to 5 seconds in verifyModelAvailabilityWithMLKit"
echo "   Test: Offline translation should be more reliable and not timeout prematurely"
echo

echo "4. SYNCHRONIZATION ENHANCEMENT"
echo "   Problem: OfflineTranslationService wasn't notified when models were downloaded/deleted"
echo "   Solution: Added ModelChangeListener interface for real-time synchronization"
echo "   Test: Download/delete models and verify translation service immediately recognizes changes"
echo

echo "5. IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING"
echo "   Problem: MLKit errors weren't properly categorized, leading to incorrect availability detection"
echo "   Solution: Enhanced error detection for network, missing model, and other error types"
echo "   Test: Error messages should be more specific and accurate"
echo

echo "=== How to Test the Fixes ==="
echo

echo "1. Test Chinese Language Consistency:"
echo "   - Go to Settings → Translation → Manage Offline Models"
echo "   - Download Chinese model (should show as 'Chinese' with code 'zh')"
echo "   - Verify translation from/to Chinese works without errors"
echo

echo "2. Test Greek Language Support:"
echo "   - Download Greek model (should be available in the list)"
echo "   - Verify Greek translations work properly"
echo "   - Check that isLanguageModelDownloaded('el') returns true"
echo

echo "3. Test Synchronization:"
echo "   - Download a model via the UI"
echo "   - Immediately check if translation is available (should work without app restart)"
echo "   - Delete a model and verify translation immediately becomes unavailable"
echo

echo "4. Test Timeout Reliability:"
echo "   - Download models and test translation multiple times"
echo "   - Should have fewer 'model not available' false negatives"
echo "   - Translation should be more reliable, especially on slower devices"
echo

echo "5. Test Error Handling:"
echo "   - Try translating without downloaded models (should give clear error messages)"
echo "   - Test with invalid language codes (should handle gracefully)"
echo "   - Check log output for better error categorization"
echo

echo "=== Expected Results After Fixes ==="
echo "✓ No more synchronization issues between model download and translation availability"
echo "✓ Chinese language translations work consistently"
echo "✓ Greek language is fully supported"
echo "✓ More reliable model availability detection"
echo "✓ Immediate synchronization when models are downloaded/deleted"
echo "✓ Better error messages and handling"
echo

echo "These fixes should resolve the 'offline translation errors are still happening' issue"
echo "mentioned in the GitHub issue. The synchronization between OfflineModelManager and"
echo "OfflineTranslationService should now work reliably."
