# First-Time Language Model Download Fix

## Issue Fixed
Addresses the bug where first-time language model downloads always fail, but retrying often works.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Restrictive Network Requirements**: Downloads required WiFi connection (`requireWifi()`), preventing downloads on mobile data
2. **Insufficient Timeout**: 60-second timeout was too short for first downloads due to ML Kit initialization overhead  
3. **No Differentiation**: System treated first downloads same as retries despite different requirements

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed WiFi Restriction
**Before:**
```java
DownloadConditions conditions = new DownloadConditions.Builder()
        .requireWifi()
        .build();
```

**After:**
```java
DownloadConditions conditions = new DownloadConditions.Builder()
        .build(); // No restrictions - allow mobile data
```

### 2. Intelligent Timeout Handling
- **First-time downloads**: 120 seconds (doubled timeout for ML Kit initialization)
- **Retry downloads**: 60 seconds (existing timeout)
- Tracks attempt type using `firstDownloadAttempts` map

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Error Messages
- Logs whether download is first attempt or retry
- Provides helpful error messages for first-time timeout failures
- Tracks download attempt history per language

## Code Changes

### OfflineModelManager.java
1. **Added timeout constants:**
   ```java
   private static final int FIRST_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120;
   ```

2. **Added tracking mechanism:**
   ```java
   private final Map<String, Boolean> firstDownloadAttempts;
   ```

3. **Updated download logic:**
   - Detect first-time vs retry attempts
   - Use appropriate timeout based on attempt type
   - Remove WiFi restrictions
   - Enhanced error messages

## Testing
Created `FirstTimeDownloadTest.java` to verify:
- First-time downloads use longer timeout
- Downloads work without WiFi restriction  
- Proper error handling for unsupported languages
- Helpful error messages for timeout scenarios

## Benefits
- **Higher Success Rate**: Removes network restrictions that blocked valid download attempts
- **Better UX**: Longer timeout for first downloads accounts for initialization overhead
- **Clearer Debugging**: Enhanced logging distinguishes first attempts from retries
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing API

## Impact
This fix specifically targets the reported issue where "first-time language model download always fails" while maintaining all existing functionality. Users should see significantly improved success rates for initial model downloads.
