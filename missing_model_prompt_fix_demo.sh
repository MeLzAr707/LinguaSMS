echo "=== Missing Language Model Download Prompt - Fix Demonstration ==="
echo ""

echo "## Issue Description"
echo "Previously, when language models were not available, users were not prompted to download them."
echo "The app would silently fail or show confusing error messages instead of offering to download models."
echo ""

echo "## Root Cause Identified"
echo "The shouldUseOfflineTranslation() method was checking model availability and returning false"
echo "when models were missing. This caused the system to:"
echo "1. Skip offline translation entirely"
echo "2. Go directly to online translation" 
echo "3. Never trigger the missing model detection logic"
echo "4. Never show the download prompt"
echo ""

echo "## Fix Applied"
echo "Modified shouldUseOfflineTranslation() to attempt offline translation even when models are missing."
echo "This ensures that:"
echo "1. Offline translation is attempted"
echo "2. Missing model error is detected"
echo "3. Download prompt is triggered (when in UI context)"
echo "4. User can download models and translation automatically retries"
echo ""

echo "## Code Changes Made"
echo ""
echo "### 1. TranslationManager.shouldUseOfflineTranslation()"
echo "BEFORE: return modelsAvailable; // Only attempt if models exist"
echo "AFTER:  return true; // Attempt offline, trigger prompt if models missing"
echo ""

echo "### 2. MessageProcessingWorker.handleTranslateMessage()"
echo "BEFORE: Result.retry(); // Retry indefinitely on any error"
echo "AFTER:  Check for missing model errors and fail gracefully"
echo ""

echo "## User Experience Flow (After Fix)"
echo ""
echo "Scenario: User translates text with missing Spanish model"
echo ""
echo "1. User taps translate button in ConversationActivity"
echo "2. shouldUseOfflineTranslation returns true (even though Spanish model missing)"
echo "3. translateOffline is called"
echo "4. OfflineTranslationService detects missing models"
echo "5. Error: 'Language models not downloaded for en -> es'"
echo "6. TranslationManager detects error contains 'Language models not downloaded'"
echo "7. EnhancedTranslationCallback context available (ConversationActivity)"
echo "8. promptForMissingModels called"
echo "9. ModelDownloadPrompt.promptForMissingModel shows dialog:"
