# Handler/Looper Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The app was crashing with the error:
```
Can't create handler inside thread Thread[pool-6-thread-1,5,main] that has not called Looper.prepare()
```

This occurred when attempting to download translation models for offline translation.

## Root Cause
The error happened in `ModelDownloadPrompt.promptForMissingModel()` at line 75 when showing an AlertDialog. The problem was:

1. `OfflineTranslationService.translateText()` runs on a background thread via `executorService.execute()`
2. When models are missing, it calls back to `TranslationManager.promptForMissingModels()`
3. This calls `ModelDownloadPrompt.promptForMissingModel()` which creates an `AlertDialog`
4. Dialog creation fails because it's happening on a background thread without a Looper

## Solution
Wrapped all dialog creation code in `activity.runOnUiThread()` to ensure dialogs are created on the main UI thread:

### Changes Made
1. **AlertDialog creation** (line 64-77): Wrapped in `activity.runOnUiThread()`
2. **ProgressDialog creation** (line 98-175): Wrapped in `activity.runOnUiThread()` for consistency

### Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ModelDownloadPrompt.java`
- `app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ModelDownloadPromptTest.java` (added test)

## Verification
- Added test case `testPromptForMissingModel_ThreadSafety_ShouldNotThrowHandlerException()` to verify the fix
- Reviewed other dialog usage in the codebase - no other threading issues found
- All other AlertDialog usage occurs on UI thread (menu clicks, button handlers, etc.)

## Impact
- Fixes the crash when downloading translation models
- Ensures reliable dialog display for model download prompts
- Maintains thread safety for all UI operations
