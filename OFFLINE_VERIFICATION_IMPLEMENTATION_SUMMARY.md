## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Integrity Check
```java
OfflineModelManager manager = new OfflineModelManager(context);

// Check if model is downloaded and verified
boolean isReady = manager.isModelDownloadedAndVerified("en");

// Get detailed status of all models
Map<String, ModelStatus> status = manager.getModelStatusMap();
```

### Comprehensive Status Check
```java
OfflineTranslationService service = new OfflineTranslationService(context, preferences);

// Get detailed status including synchronization info
Map<String, DetailedModelStatus> detailedStatus = service.getDetailedModelStatus();

for (Map.Entry<String, DetailedModelStatus> entry : detailedStatus.entrySet()) {
    String lang = entry.getKey();
    DetailedModelStatus status = entry.getValue();
    
    if (status.isDownloaded && !status.isVerified) {
        // Handle corrupted model
        System.out.println("Model " + lang + " is corrupted and needs re-download");
    }
}
```

### Download with Integrity Verification
```java
OfflineModelManager manager = new OfflineModelManager(context);
OfflineModelInfo model = getModelByLanguageCode("es");

manager.downloadModel(model, new OfflineModelManager.DownloadListener() {
    @Override
    public void onProgress(int progress) {
        // Update UI with progress
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // Model downloaded and verified successfully
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onError(String error) {
        // Handle error (includes integrity verification failures)
    }
});
```
