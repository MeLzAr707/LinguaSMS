# Demo script showing the MMS sending fix for proper MMSC configuration
echo "=== MMS Sending Fix Demo - MMSC Configuration ==="
echo "Demonstrating the fix for MMS messages not being sent..."
echo

echo "🔍 Problem Identified:"
echo "   ❌ HttpUtils.getMmscUrl() returned placeholder: 'http://mmsc.example.com/mms'"
echo "   ❌ MessageService used broadcast intent instead of transaction architecture" 
echo "   ❌ No validation of MMS configuration before sending"
echo "   ❌ Missing real carrier MMSC URL retrieval"
echo

echo "🛠️ Fix Implemented:"
echo "   1. Enhanced HttpUtils.getMmscUrl() to read real carrier settings:"
echo "      → CarrierConfigManager for carrier-specific MMSC URLs"
echo "      → APN settings fallback (content://telephony/carriers/preferapn)"
echo "      → Carrier-specific URLs for major US carriers (Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint)"
echo
echo "   2. Updated MessageService.sendMmsMessage():"
echo "      → Now uses MmsSendingHelper.sendMms() instead of broadcast intent"
echo "      → Proper transaction-based architecture"
echo "      → Validation before sending"
echo
echo "   3. Added MMS configuration validation:"
echo "      → validateMmsConfiguration() checks MMSC URL availability"
echo "      → Network connectivity verification"
echo "      → URL format validation"
echo
echo "   4. Enhanced HTTP proxy support:"
echo "      → Reads MMS proxy settings from carrier config"
echo "      → Falls back to APN proxy settings"
echo "      → Configures HTTP connections with proxy when needed"
echo

echo "📊 Expected Flow After Fix:"
echo "   1. User selects image/video attachment"
echo "   2. MessageService.sendMmsMessage() called"
echo "   3. MmsSendingHelper validates MMS configuration"
echo "   4. HttpUtils.getMmscUrl() retrieves real MMSC URL (e.g., 'http://mms.vtext.com/servlets/mms')"
echo "   5. Transaction architecture sends MMS to actual carrier MMSC"
echo "   6. Message delivered successfully"
echo

echo "🎯 Key Files Modified:"
echo "   ✅ HttpUtils.java - Real MMSC URL retrieval"
echo "   ✅ MessageService.java - Use transaction architecture"
echo "   ✅ MmsSendingHelper.java - Add validation"
echo "   ✅ AndroidManifest.xml - Add network permissions"
echo

echo "🔬 Testing the Fix:"
echo "   1. Build and install the app"
echo "   2. Send MMS with image attachment"
echo "   3. Check logcat for real MMSC URL (not placeholder)"
echo "   4. Verify message delivery to recipient"
echo

echo "📱 Sample Expected Logcat Output:"
echo "   D HttpUtils: Found MMSC URL from carrier config: http://mms.vtext.com/servlets/mms"
echo "   D HttpUtils: MMS configuration validated successfully"
echo "   D MmsSendingHelper: Using sending strategy: LollipopAndAbove"
echo "   D SendTransaction: Starting MMS send process for: content://mms/1234"
echo "   D HttpUtils: HTTP POST to: http://mms.vtext.com/servlets/mms"
echo "   D HttpUtils: HTTP response code: 200"
echo "   D SendTransaction: Send transaction completed successfully"
echo

echo "✨ Root Cause Fixed:"
echo "   The core issue was using placeholder MMSC URLs instead of real carrier settings."
echo "   MMS messages now use proper carrier MMSC endpoints for delivery."
echo

echo "Ready for testing! 🚀"
