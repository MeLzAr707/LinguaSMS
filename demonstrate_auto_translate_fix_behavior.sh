echo "=== Demonstration: Auto-Translate Message Display Fix ==="
echo

echo "This demonstrates how the fix changes the message processing flow."
echo

echo "SIMULATION: Incoming SMS with auto-translate enabled (as default SMS app)"
echo "============================================================================"
echo

# Simulate the message processing flow
echo "Step 1: SMS arrives from +17076716108 with content 'Hola'"
echo "Step 2: Android automatically stores message (since app is default SMS app)"
echo "Step 3: SmsReceiver processes SMS_DELIVER action"
echo "Step 4: MessageService.handleIncomingSms() called"
echo

echo "--- BEFORE FIX (Problematic Flow) ---"
echo "✓ Check for duplicates: isMessageAlreadyStored() returns TRUE (Android stored it)"
echo "✓ Log: 'Message already exists in database, skipping storage to prevent duplicate'"
echo "❌ Auto-translation and UI updates were tied to storage - NOT EXECUTED"
echo "❌ No UI refresh broadcast sent"
echo "❌ Message not visible in conversation thread"
echo "❌ User sees notification but no message in conversation"
echo

echo "--- AFTER FIX (Correct Flow) ---"
echo "✓ Check for duplicates: isMessageAlreadyStored() returns TRUE (Android stored it)"
echo "✓ Log: 'Message already exists in database, skipping storage to prevent duplicate'"
echo "✓ Auto-translation: ALWAYS EXECUTED regardless of storage status"
echo "✓ Log: 'Attempting auto-translation for incoming message from +17076716108'"
echo "✓ Notification: showSmsNotification() ALWAYS EXECUTED"
echo "✓ Log: 'Showed notification for SMS from +17076716108'"
echo "✓ UI Refresh: broadcastMessageReceived() ALWAYS EXECUTED" 
echo "✓ Log: 'Broadcasted message received event via LocalBroadcastManager'"
echo "✓ MainActivity receives broadcast and refreshes conversation list"
echo "✓ Message appears in conversation thread with auto-translation available"
echo

echo "KEY IMPROVEMENT:"
echo "The fix ensures that UI updates, notifications, and auto-translation"
echo "happen independently of whether the message storage is handled by"
echo "the app or automatically by Android system."
echo

echo "LOGCAT COMPARISON:"
echo "==================="

echo
echo "BEFORE FIX - Missing UI updates:"
echo "MessageService : Message already exists in database, skipping storage to prevent duplicate"
echo "MessageService : Auto-translation not performed for message from +17076716108"
echo "▶ NO further UI refresh or translation activity"

echo
echo "AFTER FIX - Complete processing:"
echo "MessageService : Message already exists in database, skipping storage to prevent duplicate"
echo "MessageService : Attempting auto-translation for incoming message from +17076716108"
echo "MessageService : Showed notification for SMS from +17076716108"
echo "MessageService : Broadcasted message received event via LocalBroadcastManager"
echo "MainActivity : Message refresh broadcast received: MESSAGE_RECEIVED"
echo "MainActivity : Refreshing conversations"
