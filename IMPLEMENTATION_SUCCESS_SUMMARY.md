## 📱 User Experience

### How Users Access Features

**Conversation Menu:**
1. Open any conversation
2. Tap Menu (⋮) → AI Features
3. Choose desired feature:
   - Summarize Conversation
   - Proofread Message  
   - Smart Reply
   - Rewrite Message

**Smart Reply Quick Access:**
1. Receive a message
2. Tap the Smart Reply button (📤)
3. Select from generated responses

### Example Workflows

**Summarizing a Conversation:**
```
Menu → AI Features → Summarize Conversation
Result: "Key topics: meeting, project. The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM in the conference room."
```

**Proofreading a Message:**
```
Type: "this is a test mesage with erors"
Menu → AI Features → Proofread Message
Result: Suggestions for "mesage" → "message", "erors" → "errors"
```

**Getting Smart Replies:**
```
Receive: "Hey, how are you doing today?"
Tap Smart Reply Button
Result: ["Hey! How's it going?", "Hi! Good to hear from you", "Hello! How are you doing?"]
```

**Rewriting Text:**
```
Type: "hey can you help me?"
Menu → AI Features → Rewrite Message → Formal
Result: "Hello, would you be able to assist me?"
```

## 🔮 Future Google Nano Integration

The implementation is designed for seamless migration to Google Nano:

1. **Interface Compatibility**: Same callback structure
2. **Modular Services**: Easy to replace implementations
3. **UI Consistency**: No UI changes needed
4. **Fallback Support**: Can maintain offline alternatives

When Google Nano becomes available as an Android SDK, the transition will be:
```java
// Current: OfflineAIService using alternative implementations
// Future: OfflineAIService using Google Nano SDK
// Interface remains the same, implementation swaps out
```
