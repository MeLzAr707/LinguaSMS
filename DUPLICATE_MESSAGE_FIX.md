# Duplicate Message Fix - Issue #262

## Problem Statement
Received messages were appearing twice in the message list, resulting in duplicated entries for each incoming message. This caused confusion and made it difficult to track conversations accurately.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `MessageService.handleIncomingSms()` method:

1. **Double Storage**: When the app is set as the default SMS app, the Android system automatically stores incoming SMS messages in the SMS database
2. **Manual Storage**: The `handleIncomingSms()` method was also manually storing every incoming message via `storeSmsMessage()` 
3. **Result**: Each incoming message was stored twice - once by the system and once by our code, causing duplicates

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conditional Message Storage
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MessageService.java`

Modified `handleIncomingSms()` to check if the app is the default SMS app before manually storing messages:

```java
// Only manually store the message if we're NOT the default SMS app
// When we are the default SMS app, Android automatically stores the message
if (!PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context)) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Not default SMS app, manually storing message");
    storeSmsMessage(senderAddress, fullMessageBody.toString(), messageTimestamp);
} else {
    Log.d(TAG, "Default SMS app - system will automatically store message");
}
```

### 2. Enhanced MainActivity Broadcast Handling
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MainActivity.java`

- Added `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` action to the broadcast receiver filter
- Registered with `LocalBroadcastManager` for more reliable intra-app communication
- Ensures conversation list refreshes when new messages arrive

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
**File:** `app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/DuplicateMessageFixTest.java`

Created tests to verify:
- Messages are NOT manually stored when app is default SMS app
- Messages ARE manually stored when app is NOT default SMS app
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## Technical Details

### When App is Default SMS App:
1. Android system automatically stores incoming SMS in database
2. Our code skips manual storage to prevent duplicates
3. Notification and UI refresh still work normally

### When App is NOT Default SMS App:
1. Android system does NOT store the message
2. Our code manually stores the message for app functionality
3. Full notification and UI refresh functionality

## Expected Results

After this fix, users should experience:
- ✅ Each received message appears only once in the conversation list
- ✅ No duplicate entries for incoming messages
- ✅ Proper message storage regardless of default SMS app status
- ✅ Consistent UI refresh when new messages arrive

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. Setting the app as default SMS app and receiving messages
2. Setting another app as default SMS app and receiving messages
3. Checking that messages appear only once in both scenarios

This fix directly addresses Issue #262 and eliminates the duplicate message problem.
