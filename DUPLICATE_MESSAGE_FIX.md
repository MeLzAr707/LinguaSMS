# Duplicate Message Fix - Issue #262

## Problem Statement
Received messages were appearing twice in the message list, resulting in duplicated entries for each incoming message. This caused confusion and made it difficult to track conversations accurately.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `MessageService.handleIncomingSms()` method where the SMS storage logic was backwards according to Android's SMS handling specification:

1. **Incorrect Understanding**: The original implementation assumed that when the app is the default SMS app, Android automatically stores messages
2. **Android Reality**: According to Android documentation:
   - **Default SMS App**: Receives `SMS_DELIVER_ACTION` intents and is **responsible for manually writing** received messages to the SMS provider database
   - **Non-Default SMS App**: Receives `SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION` intents and Android **automatically writes** the received messages to the database
3. **Result**: The logic was inverted - messages were stored manually when NOT default, but should be stored manually when IS default

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conditional Message Storage
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MessageService.java`

Modified `handleIncomingSms()` to correctly implement Android's SMS handling specification:

```java
// Only manually store the message if we ARE the default SMS app
// When we are the default SMS app, we receive SMS_DELIVER_ACTION and must manually store
// When we are NOT the default SMS app, we receive SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION and Android automatically stores
if (PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context)) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Default SMS app - manually storing message (SMS_DELIVER_ACTION)");
    storeSmsMessage(senderAddress, fullMessageBody.toString(), messageTimestamp);
} else {
    Log.d(TAG, "Not default SMS app - system will automatically store message (SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION)");
}
```

### 2. Enhanced MainActivity Broadcast Handling
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MainActivity.java`

- Added `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` action to the broadcast receiver filter
- Registered with `LocalBroadcastManager` for more reliable intra-app communication
- Ensures conversation list refreshes when new messages arrive

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
**File:** `app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/DuplicateMessageFixTest.java`

Created tests to verify:
- Messages ARE manually stored when app is default SMS app (receives SMS_DELIVER_ACTION)
- Messages are NOT manually stored when app is NOT default SMS app (receives SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION)
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## Technical Details

### When App is Default SMS App:
1. App receives SMS_DELIVER_ACTION intents from Android system
2. App is responsible for manually storing incoming SMS messages in database
3. Notification and UI refresh work normally

### When App is NOT Default SMS App:
1. App receives SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION intents from Android system  
2. Android system automatically stores the message - app should NOT store manually
3. Full notification and UI refresh functionality

## Expected Results

After this fix, users should experience:
- ✅ Each received message appears only once in the conversation list
- ✅ No duplicate entries for incoming messages
- ✅ Proper message storage regardless of default SMS app status
- ✅ Consistent UI refresh when new messages arrive

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. Setting the app as default SMS app and receiving messages
2. Setting another app as default SMS app and receiving messages
3. Checking that messages appear only once in both scenarios

This fix directly addresses Issue #262 and eliminates the duplicate message problem.
