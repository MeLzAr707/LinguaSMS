# Duplicate Message Fix - Issue #262

## Problem Statement
The logic for storing incoming SMS messages was reversed in the app. According to Android's SMS system requirements, when LinguaSMS is set as the default SMS manager, the app should be responsible for storing the incoming messages itself. However, when the app is not the default SMS manager, the Android system will automatically store incoming messages.

The previous implementation had this logic reversed, causing improper message handling.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `MessageService.handleIncomingSms()` method:

1. **Reversed Logic**: The conditional logic for storing messages was backwards according to Android SMS system requirements
2. **Incorrect Behavior**: When the app was the default SMS app, it was NOT storing messages (expecting system to handle it)
3. **Missing Responsibility**: When the app was NOT the default SMS app, it was manually storing messages (which system should handle)
4. **Result**: Improper message handling that violated Android's SMS app responsibilities

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Conditional Message Storage
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MessageService.java`

Modified `handleIncomingSms()` to properly handle message storage according to Android SMS requirements:

```java
// If we are the default SMS app, we are responsible for storing the message
// When we are NOT the default SMS app, Android system handles storage automatically
if (PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context)) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Default SMS app - manually storing message");
    storeSmsMessage(senderAddress, fullMessageBody.toString(), messageTimestamp);
} else {
    Log.d(TAG, "Not default SMS app - system will automatically store message");
}
```

### 2. Enhanced MainActivity Broadcast Handling
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MainActivity.java`

- Added `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` action to the broadcast receiver filter
- Registered with `LocalBroadcastManager` for more reliable intra-app communication
- Ensures conversation list refreshes when new messages arrive

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
**File:** `app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/DuplicateMessageFixTest.java`

Created tests to verify:
- Messages ARE manually stored when app is default SMS app
- Messages are NOT manually stored when app is NOT default SMS app
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## Technical Details

### When App is Default SMS App:
1. App is responsible for storing incoming SMS messages in database
2. Our code manually stores the message via storeSmsMessage()
3. Notification and UI refresh work normally

### When App is NOT Default SMS App:
1. Android system automatically stores incoming SMS messages
2. Our code skips manual storage to avoid conflicts
3. Notification and UI refresh functionality still work

## Expected Results

After this fix, users should experience:
- ✅ Proper message storage according to Android SMS app responsibilities
- ✅ Correct behavior when app is the default SMS manager
- ✅ Correct behavior when app is NOT the default SMS manager
- ✅ No conflicts with Android system message handling
- ✅ Consistent UI refresh when new messages arrive

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. Setting the app as default SMS app and confirming messages are stored by the app
2. Setting another app as default SMS app and confirming system handles storage
3. Checking that message behavior follows Android SMS system requirements

This fix directly addresses the reversed logic issue and ensures proper SMS message handling according to Android standards.
