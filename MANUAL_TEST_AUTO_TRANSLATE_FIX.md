# Manual Test Plan for Auto-Translate Fix (#415)

echo "=== Manual Test Plan for Auto-Translate Fix ==="
echo ""
echo "This script documents how to manually verify that the auto-translate"
echo "fix is working properly for incoming messages."
echo ""

echo "PREREQUISITES:"
echo "1. Build and install the app on a test device"
echo "2. Have a valid translation API key configured OR offline translation models"
echo "3. Enable auto-translate feature in app settings"
echo "4. Have a way to send test SMS messages to the device"
echo ""

echo "TEST STEPS:"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Enable Auto-Translate"
echo "  - Open the app settings"
echo "  - Navigate to Translation settings"
echo "  - Enable 'Auto-translate SMS' feature"
echo "  - Set target language (e.g., Spanish 'es')"
echo "  - Ensure API key is configured OR offline models are downloaded"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Test Incoming Message Translation"
echo "  - Send an SMS to the test device in a foreign language"
echo "  - Example: Send 'Hello world' from English to Spanish target"
echo "  - Observe the following expected behaviors:"
echo ""

echo "EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "✓ Message should appear in conversation list immediately"
echo "✓ Translation should occur automatically in background"
echo "✓ Check logs for success: 'Auto-translation completed for message'"
echo "✓ Check logs for caching: 'Cached auto-translation for future access'"
echo "✓ Check logs for broadcast: 'Broadcasted auto-translation completion event'"
echo "✓ UI should refresh automatically when translation completes"
echo "✓ Check logs for UI refresh: 'Auto-translation completed for message in this thread'"
echo "✓ Translated text should be available in UI (if UI supports it)"
echo "✓ Translation should be cached for future access"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Verify Translation Caching"
echo "  - Navigate to the same conversation again"
echo "  - Translation should load instantly from cache"
echo "  - No additional API calls should be made for same message"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Test Auto-Translate Disabled"
echo "  - Disable auto-translate in settings"
echo "  - Send another test message"
echo "  - Verify no automatic translation occurs"
echo "  - Check logs for: 'Auto-translation not performed'"
echo ""

echo "DEBUG LOGGING:"
echo "Use 'adb logcat | grep -E \"MessageService|MainActivity|ConversationActivity\"' to monitor:"
echo "  - 'Auto-translation completed for message from <number>'"
echo "  - 'Cached auto-translation for future access'"
echo "  - 'Broadcasted auto-translation completion event'"
echo "  - 'Auto-translation completed for message in this thread' (ConversationActivity)"
echo "  - 'Update UI when auto-translation completes' (MainActivity)"
echo "  - 'Auto-translation not performed for message from <number>'"
echo ""

echo "REGRESSION TESTS:"
echo "✓ Normal message sending still works"
echo "✓ Normal message receiving still works"
echo "✓ Manual translation (if available) still works"
echo "✓ App doesn't crash with auto-translate enabled/disabled"
echo "✓ Settings persist correctly"
echo ""

echo "KNOWN LIMITATIONS:"
echo "- Translation results are cached but UI display depends on UI implementation"
echo "- Broadcast notifications require UI components to listen for MESSAGE_TRANSLATED"
echo "- Auto-translate respects rate limiting and API availability"
