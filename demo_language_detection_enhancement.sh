# Language Detection Enhancement Demo
# Demonstrates the new ML Kit language detection with online fallback

echo "🌍 Language Detection Enhancement Demo"
echo "====================================="
echo ""
echo "This demo shows how the new language detection system works:"
echo ""

echo "📱 ML Kit Language Detection Features:"
echo "   • On-device language identification using Google ML Kit"
echo "   • Fast processing without network requests"
echo "   • Privacy-focused (no data sent to external servers)"
echo "   • Confidence threshold of 0.5 for reliable detection"
echo ""

echo "🌐 Online Fallback Features:"
echo "   • Automatic fallback to Google Translation API"
echo "   • Triggered when ML Kit returns 'undetermined'"
echo "   • Used when ML Kit confidence is below threshold"
echo "   • Provides additional coverage for edge cases"
echo ""

echo "🔄 Detection Flow:"
echo "   1. User provides text for translation"
echo "   2. ML Kit attempts on-device language detection"
echo "   3. If successful with high confidence → Use ML Kit result"
echo "   4. If ML Kit fails/low confidence → Fallback to online API"
echo "   5. If both fail → Clear error message to user"

echo "📝 Example Detection Scenarios:"

# Simulate different detection scenarios
scenarios=(
    "English:Hello world, how are you today?"
    "Spanish:Hola mundo, ¿cómo estás hoy?"
    "French:Bonjour le monde, comment allez-vous?"
    "German:Hallo Welt, wie geht es dir heute?"
    "Italian:Ciao mondo, come stai oggi?"
    "Portuguese:Olá mundo, como você está hoje?"
    "Chinese:你好世界，你今天好吗？"
    "Japanese:こんにちは世界、今日はいかがですか？"
    "Korean:안녕하세요 세계, 오늘은 어떠세요?"
    "Arabic:مرحبا بالعالم، كيف حالك اليوم؟"
)

for scenario in "${scenarios[@]}"; do
    IFS=':' read -r language text <<< "$scenario"
    echo "   Text: \"$text\""
    echo "   Expected: $language"
    echo "   Process: ML Kit detection → Confidence check → Result"
    echo ""

echo "🔧 Integration with Translation System:"
echo "   • Seamlessly integrated with existing TranslationManager"
echo "   • All translation calls now use enhanced detection"
echo "   • No changes needed to existing application code"
echo "   • Automatic detection when source language not specified"
echo ""

echo "✅ Benefits for Users:"
echo "   • Faster language detection (on-device processing)"
echo "   • More reliable detection (fallback mechanism)"
echo "   • Better privacy (ML Kit processes locally)"
echo "   • Seamless experience (transparent operation)"
echo ""

echo "🛠️ Technical Implementation:"
echo "   • LanguageDetectionService: New service handling both ML Kit and online detection"
echo "   • TranslationManager: Updated to use new detection service"
echo "   • Confidence-based logic: Smart fallback based on detection confidence"
echo "   • Error handling: Graceful degradation and clear error messages"
echo "   • Resource management: Proper cleanup of ML Kit resources"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing Coverage:"
echo "   • Unit tests for LanguageDetectionService functionality"
echo "   • Integration tests with TranslationManager"
echo "   • Edge case testing (null input, service unavailability)"
echo "   • Resource cleanup and error handling validation"
echo ""

echo "📚 Usage Examples:"
echo ""
echo "   // Synchronous detection"
echo "   String language = detectionService.detectLanguageSync(\"Hello world\");"
echo "   // Returns: \"en\""
echo ""
echo "   // Asynchronous detection with callback"
echo "   detectionService.detectLanguage(\"Bonjour\", new LanguageDetectionCallback() {"
echo "       public void onDetectionComplete(boolean success, String languageCode,"
echo "                                     String errorMessage, DetectionMethod method) {"
echo "           if (success) {"
echo "               Log.d(TAG, \"Detected: \" + languageCode + \" via \" + method);"
echo "           }"
echo "       }"
echo "   });"
echo ""
echo "   // Integration with translation (existing code works unchanged)"
echo "   translationManager.translateText(\"Hola mundo\", null, \"en\", callback);"
echo "   // Now automatically uses ML Kit detection with online fallback"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Issue #429 Resolution:"
echo "   ✅ Integrated ML Kit for on-device language detection"
echo "   ✅ Implemented robust fallback to online detection service"
echo "   ✅ Ensured seamless and transparent user experience"
echo "   ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and user notifications"
echo "   ✅ Updated documentation with detection logic and fallback sequence"
echo ""

echo "🚀 The language detection system is now significantly more robust,"
echo "   faster, and privacy-friendly while maintaining full compatibility"
echo "   with existing translation functionality!"
