# Build Errors Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Build errors were reported after the last merge, indicating missing methods and constructor signatures in key classes.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. UserPreferences.java - Missing `getTargetLanguage()` method
**Error:** `cannot find symbol - method getTargetLanguage()`
**Fix:** Added `getTargetLanguage()` method that returns the preferred language for compatibility.

```java
/**
 * Gets the target language for translations.
 * This is an alias for getPreferredLanguage() to maintain compatibility.
 *
 * @return The target language code
 */
public String getTargetLanguage() {
    return getPreferredLanguage();
}
```

### 2. OptimizedMessageCache.java - Missing constructor and method

#### Missing Context Constructor
**Error:** `constructor OptimizedMessageCache in class OptimizedMessageCache cannot be applied to given types`
**Fix:** Added constructor that accepts Context parameter while maintaining backward compatibility.

```java
/**
 * Constructor that accepts a Context parameter for compatibility.
 *
 * @param context The application context
 */
public OptimizedMessageCache(Context context) {
    this.context = context;
    initializeCaches();
}
```

#### Missing performMaintenance() method
**Error:** `cannot find symbol - method performMaintenance()`
**Fix:** Added `performMaintenance()` method for cache optimization.

```java
/**
 * Performs maintenance operations on the cache.
 * This method can be called periodically to optimize cache performance.
 */
public void performMaintenance() {
    Log.d(TAG, "Performing cache maintenance");
    
    // Log current cache statistics
    Log.d(TAG, "Current cache stats: " + getCacheStats());
    
    // Optionally trim memory if needed
    messageCache.trimToSize(MAX_MEMORY_SIZE / 2);
    
    Log.d(TAG, "Cache maintenance completed");
}
```

### 3. Code Refactoring
- Refactored cache initialization into a separate `initializeCaches()` method for better code organization
- Added Context import to OptimizedMessageCache
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing constructors

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/UserPreferences.java`
- `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/OptimizedMessageCache.java`

## Notes
The original build errors referenced files `ActivityIntegrationExample.java` and `MessageProcessingWorker.java` which were not found in the current repository. This suggests these files may have been deleted during the merge, but the code that references the missing methods in the existing classes has been fixed.

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code patterns in the project.
