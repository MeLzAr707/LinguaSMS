# ML Kit Language Detection Integration

## Overview

This update switches the app's language detection from the Google Cloud Translation API to ML Kit's Language Identification API, providing better offline capabilities and improved accuracy.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- Added `com.google.mlkit:language-id:17.0.5` dependency for ML Kit Language Identification
- Updated `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle`

### 2. New Service Created
- **OfflineLanguageDetectionService**: New service that uses ML Kit Language Identification API
  - Provides offline language detection capabilities
  - Includes confidence scoring for better accuracy
  - Handles timeouts and error cases gracefully
  - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous detection

### 3. TranslationManager Updated
- Modified to use ML Kit as the primary language detection method
- Fallback to Google Cloud API when ML Kit detection fails
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Added proper cleanup for the new service

### 4. Detection Flow
The new detection flow is:
1. **ML Kit Language Identification** (offline, primary)
2. **Google Cloud Translation API** (online, fallback)
3. **Assume English** (final fallback for offline-only mode)

## Benefits

### Improved Offline Support
- Language detection now works completely offline using ML Kit
- No internet connection required for basic language identification
- Better privacy as detection happens on-device

### Enhanced Accuracy
- ML Kit Language Identification is trained on diverse datasets
- More accurate detection for various languages and text lengths
- Confidence scoring helps filter out uncertain detections

### Reduced API Usage
- Fewer calls to Google Cloud Translation API for language detection
- Cost reduction for API usage
- Better rate limiting behavior

### Maintained Compatibility
- Existing translation functionality unchanged
- Graceful fallback to online detection when needed
- No breaking changes to public APIs

## Implementation Details

### OfflineLanguageDetectionService Features
- **detectLanguage(String text)**: Synchronous detection with timeout
- **detectLanguageAsync(String text, callback)**: Asynchronous detection
- **detectLanguageWithConfidence(String text, callback)**: Detection with confidence scores
- **isAvailable()**: Check if ML Kit is available
- **cleanup()**: Proper resource cleanup

### Configuration
- Detection timeout: 10 seconds
- Confidence threshold: 0.5 (50%)
- Fallback enabled for all translation modes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of empty/null text
- Timeout protection for long-running detection
- Proper exception handling and logging
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests in `MLKitLanguageDetectionTest.java`:
- Service initialization verification
- Integration with TranslationManager
- Error handling for edge cases
- Cleanup functionality

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- No changes required in existing code that uses TranslationManager
- Language detection is now primarily offline
- Better error handling and reliability

### For Users
- Improved language detection accuracy
- Works offline for most common languages
- Faster detection due to on-device processing
- More reliable detection in poor network conditions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Dynamic confidence threshold adjustment
- Language detection caching
- User feedback integration for detection accuracy
- Support for additional languages as ML Kit expands
- Background model updates
