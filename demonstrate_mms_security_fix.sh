echo "=== MMS SecurityException Fix Demonstration ==="
echo ""

echo "Issue Description:"
echo "- MMS sending failed with SecurityException when accessing APN settings"
echo "- Error: 'No permission to access APN settings'"
echo "- Affected carrier: Verizon (MCC/MNC: 311480)"
echo ""

echo "Root Cause:"
echo "- Modern Android versions restrict access to APN settings via ContentResolver"
echo "- Apps need special permissions that regular apps cannot obtain"
echo "- The app was trying to read MMSC URL from APN settings directly"
echo ""

echo "Fix Implementation:"
echo "1. Added WRITE_APN_SETTINGS permission to AndroidManifest.xml"
echo "2. Enhanced SecurityException handling in APN access methods"
echo "3. Improved fallback logic with comprehensive carrier database"
echo "4. Prioritized CarrierConfigManager and carrier-specific URLs over APN access"
echo "5. Added specific handling for Verizon MCC/MNC 311480"
echo ""

echo "Key Changes Made:"
echo ""

echo "1. AndroidManifest.xml:"
echo "   + Added: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS\" />"
echo ""

echo "2. HttpUtils.java - Enhanced APN methods with SecurityException handling:"
echo "   - getApnMmscUrl() now catches SecurityException specifically"
echo "   - getApnMmsProxy() now catches SecurityException specifically"  
echo "   - getApnMmsProxyPort() now catches SecurityException specifically"
echo ""

echo "3. HttpUtils.java - Improved getMmscUrl() method priority order:"
echo "   a) CarrierConfigManager (preferred)"
echo "   b) Carrier-specific database (enhanced fallback)"
echo "   c) APN settings (last resort, may fail)"
echo ""

echo "4. HttpUtils.java - Comprehensive carrier database:"
echo "   - Added exact MCC/MNC matching for major US carriers"
echo "   - Added specific entry for Verizon 311480 (from the error)"
echo "   - Added support for Verizon MVNOs (Visible, etc.)"
echo "   - Added support for T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint"
echo "   - Added Canadian carriers (Rogers, Bell, Telus)"
echo ""

echo "5. Enhanced error logging and debugging information"
echo ""

echo "Test Coverage:"
echo "- Created MmsSecurityExceptionFixTest.java"
echo "- Tests SecurityException handling"
echo "- Tests carrier-specific URL resolution"
echo "- Tests fallback mechanisms"
echo "- Validates specific Verizon MCC/MNC 311480 case"
echo ""

echo "Expected Behavior After Fix:"
echo "1. When CarrierConfigManager provides MMSC URL -> Use it (best case)"
echo "2. When CarrierConfigManager fails -> Use carrier database (Verizon = http://mms.vtext.com/servlets/mms)"
echo "3. When APN access fails with SecurityException -> Log warning and continue with fallbacks"
echo "4. No more crashes due to unhandled SecurityException"
echo "5. MMS sending should work for Verizon and other major carriers"
echo ""

echo "Verification:"
echo "- The fix specifically addresses the MCC/MNC 311480 case mentioned in the issue"
echo "- SecurityException is now caught and handled gracefully"
echo "- Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure MMS functionality"
echo "- Comprehensive logging helps with debugging future issues"
echo ""

echo "Files Modified:"
echo "- app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (added permission)"
echo "- app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/mms/http/HttpUtils.java (enhanced)"
echo "- app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/MmsSecurityExceptionFixTest.java (new test)"
