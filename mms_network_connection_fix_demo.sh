echo "=== MMS Network Connection Error Fix Demonstration ==="
echo ""

echo "Issue Description:"
echo "- Users encountering 'Failed to send MMS. Check network connection and try again.'"
echo "- Error occurs even when network appears to be active"
echo "- Issue is intermittent or related to particular carriers/devices"
echo ""

echo "Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "1. Network connectivity checking was too restrictive"
echo "2. Used deprecated NetworkInfo API that can produce false negatives"
echo "3. No retry mechanism for transient network issues"
echo "4. Generic error messages that don't help users understand the real issue"
echo ""

echo "Fix Implementation:"
echo ""
echo "1. Enhanced Network Detection (HttpUtils.java & MessageService.java):"
echo "   - Implemented modern NetworkCapabilities API for Android M+ (API 23+)"
echo "   - Maintained legacy NetworkInfo API as fallback for broader compatibility"
echo "   - Added multiple validation methods to reduce false negatives"
echo "   - Made network type checks more lenient (accept WiFi, Ethernet, etc.)"
echo ""

echo "2. Added Retry Logic (HttpUtils.java):"
echo "   - Implemented retry mechanism with 2 attempts and 1-second delay"
echo "   - Handles transient network issues that may cause temporary failures"
echo "   - Splits HTTP connection logic for clean retry handling"
echo ""

echo "3. Improved Error Messages (ConversationActivity.java):"
echo "   - Replaced generic 'Check network connection' with specific guidance"
echo "   - Added exception-specific error message analysis"
echo "   - Provides actionable steps for different failure types"
echo ""

echo "4. Better Exception Handling:"
echo "   - Network check errors now assume network is available (reduces false negatives)"
echo "   - Enhanced logging with diagnostic information"
echo "   - Graceful degradation instead of hard failures"
echo ""

echo "Code Changes Summary:"
echo ""

echo "HttpUtils.java - isNetworkAvailable() method:"
echo "BEFORE: Only used deprecated getActiveNetworkInfo()"
echo "AFTER:  Uses NetworkCapabilities API first, falls back to legacy API"
echo ""

echo "MessageService.java - isNetworkAvailableForMms() method:"
echo "BEFORE: Strict network type checking (only MOBILE and WIFI)"
echo "AFTER:  Lenient checking (includes ETHERNET, WIMAX) with capability validation"
echo ""

echo "ConversationActivity.java - Error messages:"
echo "BEFORE: 'Failed to send MMS. Check network connection and try again.'"
echo "AFTER:  'Failed to send MMS. Please check your mobile data connection and try again. If the issue persists, verify that MMS is enabled in your carrier settings.'"
echo ""

echo "Expected User Impact:"
echo "✅ Reduced false network connection errors"
echo "✅ Better success rate on marginal network conditions"  
echo "✅ More helpful error messages when MMS actually fails"
echo "✅ Automatic retry for transient network issues"
echo "✅ Support for more network types (WiFi MMS, Ethernet, etc.)"
echo ""

echo "Testing:"
echo "- Created comprehensive test suite: MmsNetworkConnectionTest.java"
echo "- Tests modern API, legacy API, WiFi, exception handling, and edge cases"
echo "- Validates that network checks are more reliable and less prone to false negatives"
echo ""

echo "Validation Steps for Users:"
echo "1. Test MMS sending on marginal network conditions"
echo "2. Verify that WiFi-based MMS works (carrier dependent)"
echo "3. Check that transient network issues are handled with retry"
echo "4. Confirm error messages are more helpful when actual failures occur"
echo ""

echo "This fix transforms the 'network connection error' from a frequent false alarm"
echo "into a reliable indicator of actual network issues, improving user experience"
echo "and reducing support tickets."
