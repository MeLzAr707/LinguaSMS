# Fix Summary: New Received Messages Display Issue (#292)

## Problem Statement
With fix-290, all received messages do not display on the thread but a notification with the message does show, which means messages are coming in but not displaying in conversation threads.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a **broadcast receiver lifecycle problem** in `ConversationActivity`:

1. **ConversationActivity registers** MESSAGE_RECEIVED broadcast receiver in `onResume()`
2. **ConversationActivity unregisters** MESSAGE_RECEIVED broadcast receiver in `onPause()`  
3. **When messages are received while the activity is not visible** (e.g., user is in MainActivity or app is in background), the MESSAGE_RECEIVED broadcast is sent but **not received**
4. **When user returns to ConversationActivity**, `onResume()` re-registers the receiver but **does not refresh the messages**
5. **Result**: New messages that arrived while not visible are never displayed

## Solution Implemented
Added a **single line** to `ConversationActivity.onResume()`:

```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    // Register message update receiver when activity becomes visible
    setupMessageUpdateReceiver();
    
    // Refresh messages to catch any updates that may have been missed
    // while the activity was not visible (MESSAGE_RECEIVED broadcasts
    // are only received when the receiver is active)
    loadMessages(); // ← This line added
}
```

## Why This Fix Works
- **Catches missed updates**: When returning to ConversationActivity, `loadMessages()` refreshes the conversation with any new messages that arrived while not visible
- **Preserves existing functionality**: All broadcast handling, message storage, and notification logic remains unchanged
- **Minimal impact**: Only 1 line of functional code added
- **Always works**: Even if broadcast mechanism fails, messages will refresh when user views the conversation

## Files Modified
1. `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ConversationActivity.java` - Added loadMessages() in onResume()
2. `app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ConversationActivityMessageDisplayFixTest.java` - Added test coverage
3. `verify_message_display_fix.sh` - Added verification script

## Verification
- ✅ Root cause identified and addressed
- ✅ Minimal surgical fix implemented  
- ✅ Test coverage added
- ✅ All verification checks pass
- ✅ No impact on existing functionality

## Expected Result
- New received messages will now display in conversation threads when users return to the conversation view
- Notifications continue to work as before
- All existing message handling functionality preserved
- Fix works regardless of timing of MESSAGE_RECEIVED broadcasts
