echo "üîç BEFORE (Problem):"
echo "--------------------"
echo "‚ùå User selects Light theme in app"
echo "‚ùå Android system is in dark mode"
echo "‚ùå App incorrectly displays dark theme (system overrides user choice)"
echo ""

echo "üîß Technical Changes Made:"
echo "-------------------------"
echo ""

echo "1. Removed Automatic Theme Override:"
echo "   Before: values-night/styles.xml overrode base AppTheme"
echo "   After:  values-night/styles.xml only overrides AppTheme_System"
echo ""

echo "2. Created Dedicated System Theme:"
echo "   - AppTheme_System: Light theme by default"
echo "   - values-night/AppTheme_System: Dark theme for night mode"
echo "   - Only used when user selects THEME_SYSTEM"
echo ""

echo "3. Updated Theme Application Logic:"
echo "   - THEME_LIGHT ‚Üí Always uses AppTheme (light)"
echo "   - THEME_DARK ‚Üí Always uses AppTheme_Dark (dark)"
echo "   - THEME_BLACK_GLASS ‚Üí Always uses AppTheme_BlackGlass (dark)"
echo "   - THEME_SYSTEM ‚Üí Uses AppTheme_System (follows system)"
