     * but this view was inside an unnamed parent container, causing layout constraint issues.
     * 
     * The fix was to:
     * 1. Add an ID to the parent container: @+id/message_input_container
     * 2. Update RecyclerView constraint to reference @+id/message_input_container
     * 3. Update empty state text view constraint to reference @+id/message_input_container

        // 2. The RecyclerView's constraint was changed from:
        //    app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/message_input_layout"
        //    to:
        //    app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/message_input_container"

        //    app:layout_constraintBottom_toTopOf="@+id/message_input_container"
