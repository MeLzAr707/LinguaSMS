- **Features**:
  - Single message summarization
  - Full conversation summarization with context awareness
  - Sentence ranking based on importance
  - Topic frequency analysis
- **Access**: Menu → AI Features → Summarize Conversation

### 2. Proofreading Service
- **Technology**: Android TextServicesManager + custom grammar rules
- **Features**:
  - Spelling error detection with suggestions
  - Grammar checking (capitalization, punctuation)
  - Style improvements (spacing, contractions)
  - Common mistake corrections
- **Access**: Menu → AI Features → Proofread Message

### 3. Smart Reply Service
- **Technology**: Template-based responses with sentiment analysis
- **Features**:
  - Context-aware reply suggestions
  - Intent detection (questions, greetings, farewells, etc.)
  - Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral, urgent)
  - Multiple reply options with variety
- **Access**: Menu → AI Features → Smart Reply OR Smart Reply Button

### 4. Text Rewriting Service
- **Technology**: Rule-based text transformation
- **Features**:
  - Multiple rewriting modes:
    - **Formal**: Expand contractions, formal language
    - **Casual**: Add contractions, informal language
    - **Concise**: Remove filler words, combine sentences
    - **Elaborate**: Add transitional phrases, explanations
    - **Polite**: Add courtesy words, soften requests
- **Access**: Menu → AI Features → Rewrite Message

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **OfflineAIService**: Main service coordinator
2. **TextSummarizationService**: Handles text summarization
3. **ProofreadingService**: Manages spelling and grammar checking
4. **SmartReplyService**: Generates contextual reply suggestions
5. **TextRewritingService**: Provides text enhancement and rewriting

### Integration Points

- **ConversationActivity**: Primary UI integration with menu options
- **Menu System**: AI Features submenu with all options
- **Layout**: Smart Reply button for quick access
- **Callbacks**: Asynchronous processing with UI feedback

### Design Principles

1. **Completely Offline**: All processing happens on-device
2. **Modular Design**: Each service is independent and replaceable
3. **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage with efficient algorithms
4. **User-Friendly**: Simple dialogs and clear feedback
5. **Future-Ready**: Easy to replace with Google Nano when available

## Usage Examples

### Summarizing a Conversation
1. Open any conversation
2. Tap Menu → AI Features → Summarize Conversation
3. View the generated summary with key topics and important messages

### Proofreading Text
1. Type a message in the input field
2. Tap Menu → AI Features → Proofread Message
3. Review suggestions and apply fixes

### Getting Smart Replies
1. Receive a message
2. Tap the Smart Reply button or Menu → AI Features → Smart Reply
3. Select from generated response suggestions

### Rewriting Text
1. Type a message in the input field
2. Tap Menu → AI Features → Rewrite Message
3. Choose rewriting mode (Formal, Casual, etc.)
4. Review and apply the rewritten version

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithms Used

1. **TF-IDF for Summarization**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for sentence scoring
2. **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions for grammar and style checking
3. **Template Matching**: Rule-based intent detection and response generation
4. **Text Transformation**: Rule-based rewriting with linguistic patterns

### Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous processing to prevent UI blocking
- Efficient text processing algorithms
- Minimal memory footprint
- Quick response times for better user experience

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Clear error messages for users
- Fallback options when processing fails
- Input validation and sanity checks

## Future Enhancements

### Google Nano Integration
When Google Nano becomes available as an Android SDK:
1. Replace service implementations with Gemini Nano calls
2. Maintain the same interface for seamless transition
3. Keep offline fallbacks for reliability

### Planned Improvements
- Conversation context learning
- User preference adaptation
- Improved language model support
- Performance optimizations
- Additional rewriting modes

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Quick access to AI-powered text features
- **Improved Communication**: Better message quality with proofreading and rewriting
- **Time Saving**: Smart replies and summarization reduce typing
- **Privacy Protection**: All processing happens locally on device
- **Offline Reliability**: Works without internet connection

### For Developers
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to maintain and extend
- **Clean Interfaces**: Simple integration with existing code
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Well-structured for unit testing
- **Documentation**: Clear code documentation and examples
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for Google Nano integration

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Test each AI feature with various text inputs
2. Verify offline functionality (airplane mode)
3. Test error handling with edge cases
4. Validate UI responsiveness and feedback

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for each service component
- Integration tests for ConversationActivity
- Performance tests for text processing
- UI tests for dialog interactions
