# Demonstration of the notification fix

echo "=== LinguaSMS Notification Fix Demo ==="
echo

echo "BEFORE the fix:"
echo "- LinguaSMS would show notifications even when not the default SMS app"
echo "- This caused duplicate notifications when users had another default SMS app"
echo "- Users would see notifications from both LinguaSMS and their default SMS app"
echo

echo "AFTER the fix:"
echo "- LinguaSMS checks PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context) before showing notifications"
echo "- If LinguaSMS is NOT the default SMS app:"
echo "  ✓ SMS notifications are skipped (prevents duplicates)"
echo "  ✓ MMS notifications are skipped (prevents duplicates)"  
echo "  ✓ UI refresh still works (messages still appear in conversation list)"
echo "  ✓ Message storage still works (messages are still saved)"
echo "- If LinguaSMS IS the default SMS app:"
echo "  ✓ Normal notification behavior (shows notifications as expected)"
echo

echo "Code changes made:"
echo "1. In MessageService.showSmsNotification():"
echo "   Added: if (!PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context)) { return; }"

echo
echo "2. In MessageService.handleIncomingMms():"
echo "   Added: if (!PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp(context)) {"
echo "            broadcastMessageReceived(); return; }"

echo
echo "Benefits of this approach:"
echo "✓ Minimal code changes (only 14 lines added)"
echo "✓ No breaking changes to existing functionality"
echo "✓ Preserves UI refresh and message storage"
echo "✓ Uses existing PhoneUtils.isDefaultSmsApp() infrastructure"
echo "✓ Includes comprehensive test coverage"
echo "✓ Proper logging for debugging"
