# Notification System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the notification system implementation for the LinguaSMS app, which now properly shows notifications when new SMS and MMS messages are received.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The app had a complete notification infrastructure (`NotificationHelper.java`) but the `MessageService.handleIncomingSms()` method was empty, so notifications were never triggered when messages arrived.

### Solution
- Implemented `MessageService.handleIncomingSms()` to parse incoming SMS and trigger notifications
- Implemented `MessageService.handleIncomingMms()` for MMS message notifications
- Connected the MMS receiver to use the new handler
- Added testing functionality for manual verification

## Features

### SMS Notifications
- Shows sender name (or contact name if available)
- Displays message content
- Plays notification sound
- Opens the conversation when tapped
- Properly handles multi-part SMS messages

### MMS Notifications
- Shows "New MMS" notification
- Can be enhanced later for more detailed MMS parsing

### Contact Integration
- Looks up contact names for better notification display
- Falls back to phone number if no contact name found

## Testing

### Manual Testing via Debug Tool
1. Open the app and navigate to the Debug activity (if enabled)
2. Enter a phone number or use the default
3. Tap "Test Notification" button
4. You should see:
   - An SMS notification immediately
   - An MMS notification after 2 seconds
   - Toast messages confirming notifications were sent

### Real Message Testing
1. Send an SMS to the device running the app
2. The notification should appear automatically
3. Tapping the notification should open the conversation

## Code Structure

### MessageService.java
- `handleIncomingSms(Intent intent)` - Processes incoming SMS and shows notifications
- `handleIncomingMms(Intent intent)` - Processes incoming MMS and shows notifications

### NotificationHelper.java (existing)
- `showSmsReceivedNotification()` - Creates and displays SMS notifications
- `showMmsReceivedNotification()` - Creates and displays MMS notifications
- `showConversationNotification()` - For grouped conversation notifications

### Receivers
- `SmsReceiver.java` - Captures incoming SMS and forwards to MessageService
- `MmsReceiver.java` - Captures incoming MMS and forwards to MessageService

### Testing Classes
- `NotificationTestHelper.java` - Programmatic testing helper
- `NotificationTest.java` - Unit tests for notification functionality
- `DebugActivity.java` - Manual testing UI

## Permissions
The app already has the required permissions:
- `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - For showing notifications
- `android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS` - For receiving SMS messages
- `android.permission.RECEIVE_MMS` - For receiving MMS messages

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced MMS parsing to show sender and content details
- Notification grouping for multiple messages from same sender
- Quick reply functionality from notifications
- Translation notifications integration
- Notification sound/vibration customization in settings
