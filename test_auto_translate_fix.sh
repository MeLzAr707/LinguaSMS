# Test script to demonstrate the auto-translate message display fix

echo "=== Testing Auto-Translate Message Display Fix ==="
echo

echo "This script simulates the problem scenario and shows how the fix resolves it."
echo

echo "PROBLEM SCENARIO:"
echo "1. App is set as default SMS app"
echo "2. Auto-translate is enabled"
echo "3. Incoming SMS arrives"
echo "4. Android automatically stores the SMS in system database"
echo "5. SmsReceiver processes SMS_DELIVER action"
echo "6. MessageService.handleIncomingSms() is called"
echo

echo "BEFORE THE FIX:"
echo "❌ Duplicate check finds existing message (stored by Android)"
echo "❌ Manual storage is skipped"
echo "❌ UI refresh and notifications were tied to manual storage"
echo "❌ Message doesn't appear in conversation thread"
echo "❌ Auto-translation might work but UI doesn't update"
echo

echo "AFTER THE FIX:"
echo "✅ Duplicate check still prevents duplicate storage"
echo "✅ Auto-translation happens regardless of storage status"
echo "✅ UI refresh broadcasts always happen"
echo "✅ Notifications always show"
echo "✅ Message appears in conversation thread"
echo "✅ Auto-translation works and UI updates properly"
echo

echo "KEY CHANGES MADE:"
echo "1. Moved auto-translation outside of storage condition"
echo "2. Added comments clarifying 'always attempt regardless of storage status'"
echo "3. Ensured broadcastMessageReceived() always runs"
echo "4. Ensured showSmsNotification() always runs"
echo "5. Maintained duplicate prevention for storage"
echo

echo "TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo "• MessageService.handleIncomingSms() now has proper flow separation"
echo "• Storage logic is independent from UI/translation logic"  
echo "• Works correctly for both default and non-default SMS app scenarios"
echo "• Maintains backward compatibility"
echo
