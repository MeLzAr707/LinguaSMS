# Offline Language Detection Fix - Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This fix implements robust offline language detection for non-English/Spanish translations using MLKit Language Identification. Previously, the app defaulted to English when it couldn't detect the source language in offline mode, causing translation failures for other language pairs.

## What Changed

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Added MLKit Language Identification**: New dependency enables offline language detection for 100+ languages
2. **Enhanced OfflineTranslationService**: Added `detectLanguageOffline()` and `detectLanguageOfflineSync()` methods
3. **Fixed TranslationManager Logic**: Replaced hardcoded English defaults with proper language detection
4. **Improved SMS Translation**: SMS messages now use offline language detection instead of assuming English

### Files Modified:
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - Added language-id dependency
- `app/build.gradle` - Added MLKit Language Identification library
- `OfflineTranslationService.java` - Added offline language detection methods
- `TranslationManager.java` - Updated to use offline detection instead of "en" default

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Prerequisites:
1. Set app to "Offline Only" translation mode in settings
2. Download language models for testing (e.g., French, German, Chinese, Arabic)
3. Ensure no Google Translate API key is configured (to force offline mode)

### Test Cases:

#### Test 1: French to English Translation
```
Input Text: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"
Expected: 
- Language detected as "fr" (French)
- Successfully translates to English
- No error about defaulting to English
```

#### Test 2: German to Spanish Translation  
```
Input Text: "Guten Tag, wie geht es Ihnen?"
Expected:
- Language detected as "de" (German)  
- Successfully translates to Spanish
- Works without requiring English as intermediate language
```

#### Test 3: Chinese to English Translation
```
Input Text: "你好，你今天好吗？"
Expected:
- Language detected as "zh" (Chinese)
- Successfully translates to English
- Properly handles non-Latin scripts
```

#### Test 4: Arabic to French Translation
```
Input Text: "مرحبا، كيف حالك اليوم؟"
Expected:
- Language detected as "ar" (Arabic)
- Successfully translates to French  
- Handles right-to-left text properly
```

#### Test 5: SMS Auto-Translation
```
Scenario: Receive SMS in Italian
SMS Text: "Ciao, come stai oggi?"
Expected:
- Automatically detects Italian ("it")
- Translates to user's preferred language
- No failure due to assuming English source
```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Look for these log messages:
   ```
   D/OfflineTranslationService: Detected language: fr for text: Bonjour, comment...
   ```

2. **Check Translation Attempts**: Should see translation attempts for all language pairs, not just English-Spanish

3. **Verify Error Messages**: Should NOT see:
   - "Could not detect language offline" (unless text is truly undetectable)
   - Failures due to defaulting to English

4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Empty text (should fail gracefully)
   - Mixed language text (should detect dominant language)
   - Very short text (may be undetectable, should handle gracefully)

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
- Offline translations only worked reliably for English ↔ Spanish
- Other language pairs failed because system assumed English as source
- Users saw translation failures for French, German, Chinese, etc.

### After Fix:
- All supported language pairs work offline 
- Proper language detection before translation
- Robust support for 100+ languages via MLKit
- Better user experience for multilingual communication

## Troubleshooting

### If Language Detection Fails:
1. Ensure MLKit Language Identification model is available
2. Check that text is sufficient length for detection (very short text may be undetectable)
3. Verify the language is supported by MLKit Language Identification

### If Translation Still Fails:
1. Confirm both source and target language models are downloaded
2. Check that language codes are properly mapped in `convertToMLKitLanguageCode()`
3. Verify offline translation models are properly installed

## Performance Notes
- Language detection adds ~1-2 seconds to translation process
- Detection is cached to avoid repeated detection of same text
- Synchronous detection includes 10-second timeout to prevent hanging
- Memory usage increases slightly due to Language Identification model

## Technical Implementation Details

### Language Detection Flow:
1. `TranslationManager` calls `OfflineTranslationService.detectLanguageOfflineSync()`
2. MLKit Language Identification analyzes text
3. Returns ISO language code (e.g., "fr", "de", "zh")
4. Code is mapped to MLKit translation language format
5. Translation proceeds with detected source language

### Error Handling:
- Handles undetectable text gracefully ("und" result)
- Timeout protection for detection operations
- Fallback error messages for debugging
- Proper null checking throughout

This fix ensures that offline translation works reliably for all supported languages, not just English and Spanish, providing a much better user experience for multilingual SMS communication.
