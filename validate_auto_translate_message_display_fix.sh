echo "The fix modifies MessageService.handleIncomingSms() to:"
echo "• Always perform UI refresh broadcasts regardless of duplicate check"
echo "• Always attempt auto-translation regardless of storage status"
echo "• Always show notifications regardless of storage status"
echo "• Maintain proper duplicate prevention for message storage"
echo "• Ensure conversation threads update for both default and non-default SMS app scenarios"
echo

echo "This ensures that incoming messages always appear in conversation threads"
echo "when auto-translate is enabled, even when the app is the default SMS app"
echo "and Android automatically stores the message."
