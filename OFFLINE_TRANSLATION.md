# LinguaSMS - Offline Translation Feature

## Overview

LinguaSMS now supports offline translation capabilities alongside the existing online translation system. This allows users to translate messages even without an internet connection by downloading language models locally. **Most importantly, offline translation works without requiring any API key setup**, making the app fully functional for translation even without online services.

## Key Features

### 1. Offline Translation Service
- **MLKit Integration**: Uses Google's MLKit Translation for high-quality offline translations
- **50+ Languages**: Supports a wide range of languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and more
- **Model Management**: Download and delete language models as needed
- **Persistent Storage**: Downloaded models are remembered between app sessions

### 2. Smart Translation Modes
- **Online Only**: Traditional cloud-based translation (requires API key and internet)
- **Offline Only**: Uses only downloaded language models (works without internet)
- **Auto Mode**: Intelligent fallback - tries offline first if preferred, falls back to online if needed

### 3. User Control
- **Translation Mode Setting**: Choose between online-only, offline-only, or auto mode
- **Prefer Offline Option**: In auto mode, prefer offline translation when available
- **Model Management**: Dedicated interface to download and manage language models
