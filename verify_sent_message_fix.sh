echo "This fix addresses the race condition where:"
echo "1. ConversationActivity.sendMessage() called loadMessages() directly"
echo "2. MessageService.broadcastMessageSent() sent broadcast immediately" 
echo "3. Both triggered loadMessages() before SMS was stored in database"

echo "The fix:"
echo "1. Removes direct loadMessages() call from ConversationActivity.sendMessage()"
echo "2. Adds 500ms delay to MESSAGE_SENT broadcast"
echo "3. Handles cache clearing and pagination reset in broadcast receiver"
echo "4. Eliminates race condition and ensures message appears in conversation"
