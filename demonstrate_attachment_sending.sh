# Demonstration of Attachment Sending Implementation
# This script documents the key features and usage of the attachment functionality

echo "=== LinguaSMS Attachment Sending Implementation Demo ==="
echo ""

echo "## Key Features Implemented:"
echo ""

echo "1. ATTACHMENT SELECTION:"
echo "   - Tap attachment button (ðŸ“Ž) to open file picker"
echo "   - Select any file type (images, videos, documents, etc.)"
echo "   - Toast notification confirms attachment selection"
echo "   - Attachment URI is stored in selectedAttachments list"
echo ""

echo "2. SMART SEND MODE DETECTION:"
echo "   - With attachments: Automatically uses MMS"
echo "   - Without attachments: Uses regular SMS"
echo "   - Empty text allowed when attachments are present"
echo "   - Multiple attachments supported (can select multiple files)"
echo ""

echo "3. USER FEEDBACK:"
echo "   - Toast shows 'Attachment selected: [filename]'"
echo "   - Toast shows '[X] attachment(s) ready to send' when selecting more"
echo "   - Clear visual indication of MMS mode vs SMS mode"
echo ""

echo "4. ATTACHMENT MANAGEMENT:"
echo "   - Long-press attachment button to clear all selected attachments"
echo "   - Toast confirmation: 'Attachments cleared'"
echo "   - Attachments automatically cleared after successful send"
echo ""

echo "5. ACTIVITIES UPDATED:"
echo "   - ConversationActivity: Send attachments in existing conversations"
echo "   - NewMessageActivity: Send attachments when creating new conversations"
echo "   - Both activities use identical attachment handling logic"
echo ""

echo "## Technical Implementation:"
echo ""

echo "### ConversationActivity Changes:"
echo "- Added: List<Uri> selectedAttachments field"
echo "- Modified: sendMessage() method to handle MMS when attachments present"
echo "- Updated: onActivityResult() to store attachment URIs"
echo "- Added: updateSendButtonForAttachments() for user feedback"
echo "- Added: Long-press handler on attachment button"
echo ""

echo "### NewMessageActivity Changes:"
echo "- Same attachment storage and handling implementation"
echo "- Modified sendMessage() to handle both SMS and MMS flows"
echo "- Proper integration with conversation opening after send"
echo ""

echo "### MessageService Integration:"
echo "- Uses existing sendMmsMessage() method (already fully implemented)"
echo "- Parameters: sendMmsMessage(address, null, messageText, attachmentList)"
echo "- No changes needed to MessageService - it was already complete"
echo ""

echo "## User Flow Examples:"
echo ""

echo "### Example 1: Send Image in Conversation"
echo "1. Open existing conversation"
echo "2. Tap attachment button (ðŸ“Ž)"
echo "3. Select image from gallery"
echo "4. See 'Attachment selected: image.jpg'"
echo "5. Type message (optional)"
echo "6. Tap send - message sent as MMS"
echo ""

echo "### Example 2: Send Document in New Message"
echo "1. Tap 'New Message' (+ button)"
echo "2. Enter recipient"
echo "3. Tap attachment button (ðŸ“Ž)"
echo "4. Select document file"
echo "5. See '1 attachment(s) ready to send'"
echo "6. Add text or leave empty"
echo "7. Tap send - MMS sent and conversation opens"
echo ""

echo "### Example 3: Clear Attachments"
echo "1. Select one or more attachments"
echo "2. Long-press attachment button (ðŸ“Ž)"
echo "3. See 'Attachments cleared' toast"
echo "4. Send button returns to normal SMS mode"
echo ""

echo "## Code Changes Summary:"
echo ""

echo "### Files Modified:"
echo "- app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ConversationActivity.java"
echo "- app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/NewMessageActivity.java"
echo ""

echo "### Files Added:"
echo "- app/src/test/java/com/translator/messagingapp/AttachmentSendingTest.java"
echo ""

echo "### Key Methods Added:"
echo "- updateSendButtonForAttachments() - provides user feedback"
echo "- Modified sendMessage() methods - handle SMS/MMS selection"
echo "- Enhanced onActivityResult() methods - store attachment URIs"
echo "- Long-press handlers for attachment button - clear attachments"
echo ""

echo "## Testing Approach:"
echo ""

echo "### Manual Testing:"
echo "1. Open app and navigate to conversation"
echo "2. Test attachment selection and sending"
echo "3. Verify MMS vs SMS behavior"
echo "4. Test attachment clearing functionality"
echo "5. Test with various file types"
echo ""

echo "### Automated Testing:"
echo "- AttachmentSendingTest.java covers core logic"
echo "- Tests attachment storage, MMS selection, and clearing"
echo "- Integrates with existing test infrastructure"
echo ""

echo "=== Implementation Complete ==="
echo ""
echo "The attachment sending functionality is now fully implemented!"
echo "Users can select and send attachments seamlessly via MMS."
echo "The implementation reuses existing infrastructure and requires no schema changes."
