# ML Kit Dictionary Loading Fix

## Issue Summary
ML Kit translation models were downloading successfully but failing during translation with dictionary loading errors such as:
- "Failed to load a new file: merged_dict_en_es_25_both.bin"  
- "Error loading dictionary: 1"

## Root Cause
The model verification was using insufficient timeouts (2 seconds) for ML Kit's dictionary files to properly initialize. While the model files were downloaded, the dictionary components within those models needed more time to load and become accessible.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Model Verification Timeouts
- **Before**: 2-second timeout for model verification
- **After**: 10-second timeout to allow proper dictionary initialization
- **Impact**: Gives ML Kit adequate time to load dictionary files after model download

### 2. Improved Retry Logic
- **Before**: 5-second timeout for dictionary loading retry
- **After**: 15-second timeout with 2-second initialization delay
- **Impact**: More robust recovery from temporary dictionary loading failures

### 3. Prioritized ML Kit Verification
- **Before**: Checked placeholder files first, then ML Kit as fallback
- **After**: Checks ML Kit directly as primary verification method
- **Impact**: Ensures actual ML Kit functionality is tested, not just file presence

### 4. Enhanced Error Detection
- **Before**: Generic error handling for all translation failures
- **After**: Specific detection and handling of dictionary loading errors
- **Impact**: Better user guidance for corrupted models requiring redownload

## Technical Changes

### Modified Methods
1. `verifyModelAvailabilityWithMLKit()` - Increased timeout and enhanced logging
2. `retryTranslationWithDictionaryFix()` - Extended retry timeout and delay
3. `isOfflineTranslationAvailable()` - Prioritizes ML Kit verification
4. `retryTranslationAfterDictionaryError()` - Better error detection and recovery

### Key Timeout Adjustments
- Model verification: 2s → 10s
- Dictionary retry: 5s → 15s  
- Initialization delay: 1s → 2s

## Expected Results
- Translation should work after model downloads complete
- Dictionary loading errors should be significantly reduced
- Better error messages guide users to redownload corrupted models
- More reliable offline translation availability detection

## Testing
- Added `MLKitDictionaryLoadingTest` to verify enhanced verification logic
- Existing tests continue to pass with improved timeout handling
- Manual testing should show successful translation after model download completion
