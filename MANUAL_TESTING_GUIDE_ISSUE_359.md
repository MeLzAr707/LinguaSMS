# Manual Testing Guide for Issue #359 Fix

## Issue Description
Message bubble translation failure with error toast saying "models may not be loaded correctly" while text input translation succeeds.

## Root Cause Fixed
The issue was caused by inconsistent language selection between message bubble translation and text input translation:
- Text input used: `getPreferredOutgoingLanguage() ?? getPreferredLanguage()`
- Message bubble used: `getPreferredLanguage()` only

This caused different offline model availability checks, leading to failures.

## Fix Applied
Modified `translateMessage()` method in ConversationActivity.java to use the same language selection logic as `translateInput()` method.

## Manual Testing Steps

### Setup
1. Set up different language preferences:
   - Go to Settings > Language Preferences
   - Set "Preferred Language" to English (en)
   - Set "Preferred Outgoing Language" to Spanish (es)

2. Download offline models:
   - Go to Settings > Manage Offline Models
   - Download Spanish language model
   - Do NOT download English model (to test the specific scenario)

3. Set translation mode to "Auto" or "Offline Only"

### Test Scenario 1: Text Input Translation
1. Open any conversation
2. Type "Hello world" in the message input
3. Tap the translate button (üåê) next to the input
4. **Expected**: Translation succeeds to Spanish
5. **Verify**: No error about models not being loaded

### Test Scenario 2: Message Bubble Translation  
1. In the same conversation, find any English message
2. Tap the translate button on the message bubble
3. **Expected**: Translation succeeds to Spanish (same as input)
4. **Verify**: No error about models not being loaded
5. **Verify**: Uses the same target language as text input translation

### Test Scenario 3: Consistency Check
1. Both translation methods should now:
   - Use Spanish as target language (from preferredOutgoingLanguage)
   - Successfully translate using available Spanish offline models
   - NOT attempt English translation (which would fail due to missing models)

### Test Scenario 4: Fallback Behavior
1. Clear the "Preferred Outgoing Language" setting (set to empty/null)
2. Keep "Preferred Language" as English
3. Ensure English offline models are available
4. Test both translation methods
5. **Expected**: Both should use English as target language

## Before vs After Behavior

### Before Fix
- Text input translation: ‚úÖ Works (uses Spanish models)
- Message bubble translation: ‚ùå Fails with "models may not be loaded correctly" (tries English models)

### After Fix
- Text input translation: ‚úÖ Works (uses Spanish models)
- Message bubble translation: ‚úÖ Works (uses Spanish models, same as input)

## Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ Both translation methods use identical target language selection
2. ‚úÖ No more "models may not be loaded correctly" errors when models are actually available
3. ‚úÖ Consistent behavior between text input and message bubble translation
4. ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility maintained for users without outgoing language preference

## Code Changes Summary
- File: `app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ConversationActivity.java`
- Method: `translateMessage()` (around line 720)
- Change: Added same language selection logic as `translateInput()` method
- Lines added: 4 lines for consistent language selection
- Impact: Minimal, surgical fix addressing only the specific inconsistency
