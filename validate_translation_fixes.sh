# Translation Bug Fixes Validation Script
# This script provides manual validation steps for the translation issues fixes

echo "=== Translation Bug Fixes Validation ==="
echo ""

echo "This script helps validate the fixes for translation issues #339:"
echo "1. Translation button incorrectly reports 'text is already in English'"
echo "2. Offline translation reports 'language models not downloaded'"
echo ""

echo "=== CHANGES MADE ==="
echo ""

echo "1. TRANSLATION BUTTON FIX:"
echo "   File: app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/ConversationActivity.java"
echo "   Change: Added forceTranslation=true parameter to translateText() call on line 728"
echo "   Before: translationManager.translateText(message.getBody(), targetLanguage, callback)"
echo "   After:  translationManager.translateText(message.getBody(), targetLanguage, callback, true)"
echo ""

echo "2. OFFLINE TRANSLATION FIX:"
echo "   File: app/src/main/java/com/translator/messagingapp/OfflineTranslationService.java"
echo "   Changes:"
echo "   - Enhanced isOfflineTranslationAvailable() to verify with MLKit directly"
echo "   - Added verifyModelAvailabilityWithMLKit() method"
echo "   - Added automatic sync between internal tracking and MLKit state"
echo ""

echo "=== MANUAL TESTING STEPS ==="
echo ""

echo "To manually test these fixes:"
echo ""

echo "1. TRANSLATION BUTTON TEST:"
echo "   a. Open the app and navigate to a conversation"
echo "   b. Find a message and tap the translate button"
echo "   c. BEFORE FIX: Would show 'Translation Failed: text is already in English'"
echo "   d. AFTER FIX: Should attempt translation even if text is detected as English"
echo "   e. For messages in same language as target, translation should proceed"
echo ""

echo "2. OFFLINE TRANSLATION TEST:"
echo "   a. Download language models through Settings > Manage Offline Models"
echo "   b. Switch to offline-only translation mode"
echo "   c. Try translating text"
echo "   d. BEFORE FIX: Would show 'language models not downloaded' even when available"
echo "   e. AFTER FIX: Should detect models are available and translate successfully"
echo ""

echo ""
echo "=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIXES ==="
echo ""

echo "1. TRANSLATION BUTTON:"
echo "   - Should work for any text, regardless of detected language"
echo "   - Should force translation even when source and target languages match"
echo "   - Should no longer show 'text is already in English' error for UI-triggered translations"
echo ""

echo "2. OFFLINE TRANSLATION:"
echo "   - Should properly detect when MLKit models are available"
echo "   - Should sync internal tracking with MLKit's actual model state"
echo "   - Should no longer show 'language models not downloaded' when models are available"
echo "   - Should gracefully fallback to online translation when offline fails"

echo "=== SUMMARY ==="
echo ""
echo "These minimal changes address the specific translation issues reported:"
echo "- Fixed UI-triggered translations to use forceTranslation=true"
echo "- Enhanced offline model availability checking with MLKit verification"
echo "- Added automatic sync between internal tracking and MLKit state"
echo "- Created comprehensive tests to verify the fixes"
echo ""
echo "The changes are surgical and focused, avoiding any unnecessary modifications"
echo "to the existing codebase while fully addressing the reported issues."
