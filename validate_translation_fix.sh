echo "Changes made to fix non-English translation issues:"
echo "- Added forceTranslation=true to incoming message translation"
echo "- Improved language detection to use online detection when available"
echo "- Added language inference for offline translation"
echo "- Added detection of identical text returned by MLKit"
echo "- Created comprehensive test coverage"

echo ""
echo "Expected behavior after fixes:"
echo "- Non-English input should be properly detected and translated"
echo "- Chat bubble translation should work with force translation"
echo "- Offline translation should infer source language intelligently"
echo "- No more 'Translation returned identical text' errors"
